# Resource: signalfx_jira_integration

Splunk Observability Cloud Jira integrations. For help with this integration see [Integration with Jira](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/integrate-notifications.html#integrate-with-jira).

~> **NOTE** When managing integrations, use a session token of an administrator to authenticate the Splunk Observability Cloud provider. See [Operations that require a session token for an administrator](https://dev.splunk.com/observability/docs/administration/authtokens#Operations-that-require-a-session-token-for-an-administrator). Otherwise you'll receive a 4xx error.

## Example

```tf
resource "signalfx_jira_integration" "jira_myteamXX" {
  name    = "JiraFoo"
  enabled = false

  auth_method = "UsernameAndPassword"
  username    = "yoosername"
  password    = "paasword"

  # Orâ€¦
  #auth_method = "EmailAndToken"
  #user_email = "yoosername@example.com"
  #api_token = "abc123"

  assignee_name         = "testytesterson"
  assignee_display_name = "Testy Testerson"

  base_url    = "https://www.example.com"
  issue_type  = "Story"
  project_key = "TEST"
}
```
